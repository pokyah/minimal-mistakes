## Strategy

what explains temperature ? 

- position ==> same
- elevation ==> same
- solar radiation ==> dynamic
- aspect ==> same

1. Choose sample from whole dataset (randomly but incoporating all the seasons) : set.seed random subset (how many) hourly observation on the 20 years TMY period basis for all stations
2. This sample will be refered as dataset here below
2. Check if dataset presents spatial homogeneity or not : compute local means for all stations. A visible trend ? Will need to be detrended. ==> https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/57357/tests-for-spatial-stationarity-homogeneity. Make histogram separated for example below and above a certain elevation (elevation could be an excellent explanation to spatial Temperature heterogeneity) =>  where ? Look at the distribution of stations elevation. To restore the hypothesis of spatial homogeneity, we would like the histograms to be independant of location. Is there a clear trend that can be fitted between temperature and elevation for our whole ? dataset ==> presumably yes. trend usually refers to a change in the mean over space. To detrend subtract the deviations from the least squares fit line (i.e. the differences) from your data.https://econometricswithr.wordpress.com/tag/detrend/ and http://www.statisticshowto.com/detrend-data/

To show to power of the found trend, we can only keep the temperature of a single year and see if the same trend (slope) is seen !
